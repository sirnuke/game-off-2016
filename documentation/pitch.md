# THE YEAR IS 199X

You, hackerman, have your gotten your hands on figurative gold: a bona fide ShadowGovernment
terminal PC, containing both dark secrets and access to ShadowNet.

All that stands in front of you are pesky integrity checks of each component of
the system...

* Internally simulated PC running ShadowOS.
* Each component implemented in the most advanced, most shadowy programming language; ShadowBasic
* Player can modify each component, but must pass various integrity checks
* Each component has different checks, ranging from checksums (hard), to program length,
  to random programming restrictions like max number of IF statements.
* Player switches running the PC and having access to the ShadowOS's ShadowConsole, to seeing
  an overview of known components, to modifying a component.

Can hackerman achieve hackerglory!?
